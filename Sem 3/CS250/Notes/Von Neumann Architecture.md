# Von Neumann Architecture
> a computer design where programs (instructions) and data share the same memory and bus, using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU) to fetch, decode, and execute instructions sequentially from this single memory

Arrows indicate information flow

Both programs and data can be stored in the same memory

## 0 Stored-Program Concept
> Both instructions and data reside in the same memory, allowing programs to be easily changed.

## 1 Input / Output
> Places where the machine can receive signals from an outside source
> Places where the machine can send signals to an outside source

## 2 [[➡️ Memory]]
> Storage, a place to represent values that you would like to represent in the device
## 3 [[🔴 8 Control and Task Management]]
