# Missing notes
If you come across a term you don't understand, check the "terminology" section at the bottom of the note.

Note about floating point numbers is in a different note because i have learned bout them previously. I can send the note separately to you.

# Practice Problems
There are a set of practice problems that i cannot release due to academic integrity policies. Sorry for the inconvenience
